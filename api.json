      "full": "Harpies are creatures from Greek mythology portrayed as having a woman's head and torso with the wings, talons, and lower body of a bird. Originally conceived as wind spirits and daughters of Thaumas and Electra, they evolved from beautiful winged maidens to grotesque monsters in later mythology. Known as \\\"the snatchers,\\\" harpies were said to snatch away food, carry off people, and torment victims, most famously the blind prophet Phineus whom they plagued by fouling his food until freed by the Argonauts. The three most famous harpies are **Aello** (storm swift), **Ocypete** (swift wing), and **Celaeno** (dark). They possessed incredible flight speed and the ability to carry away people or objects. Harpies came to symbolize divine punishment, guilt, and sudden disappearance. The term \\\"harpy\\\" has evolved in modern usage to mean a shrewish or nagging woman, representing a negative linguistic evolution."
